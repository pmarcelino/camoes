The term "cognitive computing" refers to systems that learn at scale, reason with purpose, and interact with humans naturally. These systems are designed to mimic the human brain's ability to learn, understand, and make decisions. They use machine learning algorithms and artificial intelligence to automate reasoning, problem-solving, and data analysis. Cognitive computing systems can process vast amounts of complex information, learn from their interactions with data and humans, and improve their capabilities over time. They are used in various fields, including healthcare, finance, and customer service, to provide personalized and contextually relevant experiences, make informed decisions, and solve complex problems.
