The term "cognitive computing" refers to systems that learn at scale, reason with purpose, and interact with humans naturally. It is a subfield of artificial intelligence that strives to create computers or software that can mimic human thought processes and decision-making. This is achieved through the use of machine learning algorithms and deep learning networks. Cognitive computing systems can analyze vast amounts of data, identify patterns, and make predictions or decisions based on that analysis, much like a human brain.
